                <!-- For the hamburger menu I found an online tutorial : https://youtu.be/ydZc17rlR5E by Florin Pop and used some of his code after I fully understood it, it's pretty straight forward actually: you create a button, import the symbol using font awesome, then using @media queries css we, set the properties of the button to hide when the screen is big enough and we don't need a hamburger menu , but when the page is small, we set the navigation link to hide and the hamburger menu to show. Later we manipulate this in javascript using an event listener that checks for a click on the element id bars as soon as bars is clicked, it changes the css property of navigation links to show -->

                http://codepen.io/kevinpowell/pen/GrLKNo. after fully grasping what he did.
                I have changed multiple things in the code, such as, changing the position of the nav bar, adding a:hover effects, using my fonts and colors, changing the height of the animation bar and etc. I have also added a hamburger menu for smaller size screens-->

        <!--For breadcrumb navigation i was inspired by w3school's simple article on it which I tried to implement after fully understanding it. I fully changed the code to implement in the website for example, I changed the typical styles, such as margins, padding, background, font-size, display, etc. I also changed the symbols between the navigations links. The code is very simple, I really didn't have to look for it online, but I have to say I was inspired by that.

What it basically does is: it uses a font aweosme icon library and each element is called in by a specific font awesome class and then you easily style the icons as normals using css. i.e. giving it a backgroubnd etc. I added links and edited the links to have realistic accounts -->
