        <h1>Report: Large Coursework</h1>
        <h2>Name: Fatemeh Abbasi Razgaleh</h2>
        
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        
        <p> For the final project, I decided to create a newsletter website for a chess club at the University of London, Goldsmith. My website's name is Goldsmith Chess Club Newsletter or GCCN, in short. The premise of the essential story being told by GCCN's website is to create a space for the new and current club members to get the information they are looking for and to encourage new chess players in the university to join the club. The website is supposed to make new members feel welcome and introduce them to chess and give the news, event information, and a join newsletter form to the current or new members. The website is also supposed to look professional and as classy as possible to leave a good impression on any user about the club and chess generally. As much as I wanted to website to look professional, I also didn't want to make it look too serious so that people who are new to chess don't feel uninterested right away.</p>
        
        <p>To make this story happen, I had to use a certain type of structure. For example, I added a calendar so that the current and new members of the club would know when is the next event happening. I also added an archive as a structure, inside the news page, so that the current users can go back a few months or years to know what they might have missed. The beginner lessons page has a quick bites structure for new members to get introduced to chess and not feel intimidated. Furthermore, I tried to use elegant colors to leave a professional impression but also used "light" colors as highlights (i.e. when you hover over links) to add a small amount of fun and not-always-serious vibes. I wanted chess to seem a bit more interesting rather than just plain classy boring.</p>
        
        <p> Another example would be, for the newsletter part of the website to also fit well in the story, I added a join newsletter form structure as well as a news page. The premise of the form is that if the user doesn't want to check the website for the latest news constantly, they can sign up for a newsletter. However, to keep the website serious and classy, they have the option to not sign up for the newsletter and fill in their first and last name and email to be officially joined as a club member.</p>
        
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        
        <p>I drew inspiration from many cited sources. I  think they were a huge part of this creative process. To create the website, I looked up many chess club websites to get an idea of how it has been implemented in real life. I saw everything, from pure HTML to very well-done professional websites. There were two that caught my eyes. <a href="https://www.saintlouischessclub.org">Saint Louis Chess Club </a> and <a href="https://www.fide.com">International Chess Federation</a> itself.</p> 
            
        <p>  I was very impressed by the classy look of Saint Louis Chess Club's website. However, I didn't want GCCN to be nearly as serious-looking. In my opinion, that would have been great for a chess club open to the general public such as Saint Louis Chess Club, but for a chess club for the university, I just wanted to grab my audiences attention and keep the environment also fun looking rather than give it the feel of an exclusive club. I also really liked how the color scheme was implemented to give an elegant impression and inspired by the color scheme I also chose a slightly similar color that has a warmer tone and is much more friendly looking and added many different colors to the website's color pallet. The color turned out to also match the name I had chosen for the website: Goldsmith Chess Club Newsletter! To find the perfect color pallet, I even looked at the university colors and also came across a great random color generator website called <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolers.co</a>. With the inspirations that I received from all the above, I finally landed on a color scheme that matches my logo. So in a way the contributor Mansaabguru on <a href="https://www.flaticon.com">Flat Icon</a> who created the icon I used for the website inspired me to find the right color pallet that matches my website. And as for International Chess Federation's website, I liked the to-the-point layout on their home page. No waste of time. So I also implemented something similar but with different layouts.</p>
        
        
        <p>Lastly, one of the recent events that have been happening on the Twitch platform is streaming chess tournaments due to the COVID-19 pandemic and even Twitch made an event tournament called PogChamps to keep people more entertained. As an intermediate chess player, I found the streaming events very enjoyable and I'm really happy that more people are playing chess as a hobby, whether it's from watching the twitch tournaments or watching the Netflix show Queen's Gambit. I always wished I knew more people who like to play chess, but what I found is that most people -mainly my friends- feel very intimidated by chess almost in the same way that some people do about math, and to them, it could really feel like an exclusive club full of geniuses, but in truth, it's not like that necessarily, especially at an intermediate level. All these, together, inspired me to make an imaginary club that would make people feel welcome to play chess for the first time as well as keep a community of chess players feels lively.</p>
        
        <h2>Accessibility</h2>
        
        <p>As I was making the website, I had accessibility greatly in mind. To begin with, I made sure each photo has a clear alt tag that describes the content of the photo well and succinctly. So that a possible user in need of accessibility features could still manage to use the website.</p>
        
        <p>Secondly, the join form on the join page has highlights when you focus on different parts of the form, that allows users to know where they have clicked. The join form allows users to make mistakes and alerts them that they have done something wrong and need to feel the correct slots. The form is easy to fill with a keyboard and no mouse. </p>
        
        <p>Thirdly, I made the website from the desktop to the phones. I wanted any user with almost any device to be able to experience the website as professionally as possible. This feature alone makes the website accessible to a great number of users.</p>
        
        <p>Last Accessibility feature that I have added is video transcripts for the YouTube videos that I have embedded in my website in the page Beginner Lessons. I realized that those videos didn't come with subtitles and decided to add the content there in writing for the users who use text-to speech. </p>
        
        <h2>Usability</h2>
        
        <p>As mentioned before, I wanted the website to be used, attract, and give proper information to any user. To achieve this, I first tried to create a good interface that users may be familiar with from their experience before with any website and they don't need to figure out how to use my website. I wanted to tap into the web intuition of any web user. I also had to make sure that goal, stands for desktop as well as laptops, tablets, or phones. That meant that I had to make sure almost any element in the website can get resized and are comfortable with layout changes. This also made the website responsive.</p> 
            
        <p>Secondly, related to the first point I was making, to make the website function on a wide range of devices, I needed to make sure the navigation bar is usable, and simple enough to navigate whether you are on a desktop or a phone especially since simplicity in your design can add greatly to the usability of your website. For tablet and phone, I made a slightly different layout for the website, using what's called "hamburger menu". It does the job efficiently and most tablet and mobile users are familiar enough with it to recognize that the three-bar symbol means navigation menu. This also meant that I include breadcrumb navigation that lets user know which page they have landed on as well as making sure the HTML title of each page is the same as the page title so the user also knows where they are in the website by glancing over the tab's name on their browser.</p>
        
        <p>Thirdly, I tried to make a clean and clear-looking website, to make it easier for the readers to read the content. Use easy to read font called "Montserrat" with a decent weight against a mostly white background that allows the user to read the content of the website without getting frustrated or lost. I wanted to the website to be easy to scan and therefore increase the readability of the website. Creating a layout with clear titles or tags made this happen easily.</p>
        
   
        
        <h2>Strengths</h2>
        
        <p>I'm proud of how I was able to make the website accessible and usable on all four major screens: Desktop, Laptop, Tablet, and Phone. This feels like an achievement since I had no prior experience with it and I just kept playing with the @media queries in CSS and figured it out! I think that's a strength of the website. I am content with how it turned out.</p>
        <p>Another strong point of the website, in my opinion, is that I was able to achieve the goal I had set as mentioned in the introduction. In my opinion, GCCN's website looks professional but doesn't look too serious that would not attract any user. I was able to implement to make the website look friendly as well as professional in my opinion.</p>
        <p>I also think that the navigation animation turned out to look elegant as well. I like that my website doesn't have annoying animations everywhere and is not spamming the user and gives users choices (for example in the join form). I think all of that adds to its strengths.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Weaknesses</h2>
        
        <p>I think the Home Page could have included more items, so you could consider that a weakness. I also think the mock calendar has only used CSS and HTML. It would have been much better if the calendar had some Javascript but I ran out of time and I thought the calendar does the job properly enough by just hovering over the dates and seeing the event of a certain date.</p>
        
        <p>Another thing I would have done differently, would be to first design a mobile website and then move to desktop because that way is so much easier. Unfortunately, this time around, I started with wireframes of a desktop and added mobile designs later and that meant changing quite a few things. If you start with mobile in mind first, you are easily able to move the different sections to create a desktop layout. So I would like to do that next time I build a website.</p>
