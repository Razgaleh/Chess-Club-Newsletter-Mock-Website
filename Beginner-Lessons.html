        <p>New to chess? No need to worry about it! We've got you covered. Below are few beginner lessons our new members find quite useful.</p>

                    <p >Remembering each piece's possible movements may be difficult at first, but rest assured, you will get a hang of it in a short amount of time! Here's a list of how each piece moves:</p>
                
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>King</strong>: King can move in any direction by one square. This means king can move diagonally, horizonatally, and vertically. 
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Queen</strong>: Queen is strongest and most valued piece strategically in a chess game. That is because it can easily move any number of squares in any direction.</li>
                            <li><strong>Rook</strong>: Rooks can only move any number of squares i either horizontal direction or vertical direction. </li>
                            <li><strong>Knight</strong>: Knights are the only pieces that have a bit of an unconventional movement called the "L" shaped move. Knights can go two squares up/down/left/right and from the second square, one square to either left/right/up/down. (Definitely checkout the guide for this one.) </li>
                            <li><strong>Bishop</strong>: Bishops can only move diagonally with any number of squares.</li>
                            <li><strong>Pawn</strong>: In the beginning of the game, when pawns are at the starter location, they can move either one or two squares up. After the first move of the pawn, they can only move one square up.</li>
                        </ul>
                    
                    <p>Here's a great image guide that we found online that we hope it would help:</p>

                <div id="lesson-2-dscrp">
                     <p>Now it's times to to setup the chessboard, since that's what you gotta do before you start a game! Before we start, we need to figure out which color goes on which side. There are many ways to figure this out, for example, one way is that the king is always on an opposite color square and it's position is the fourth column from the right.</p>
                         
                     <p>After figuring out which color goes on which side, then you can start by setting the row of of each color pawns on the second row down from the top and second row up from the bottm. Then put the rooks at each corner right behind the pawns of their color. Right next to the rooks goes the knights and right next to knight we should set up the bishops. King  goes right next to the bishop on the right and queen goes next to bishop on the left.</p>
                    
                    <p>Here's a great video we found on YouTube from Chess.com that explains this lesson perfectly:</p>
                    
                    <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1mshvpn8NLI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <!--Credit of the video to chess.com's youtube channel -->
                    
                    
                    <p><small>[Transcript of the video above]: "Now that you know how the chess pieces move, it's time to setup the game. Before you put the pieces on make sure you turn the chess board so that there's light square in bottom right corner. You can remember this as white on the right. The easiest way to start placing the pieces is to place all of the pawns on the second rank for each side. In chess rank is the word for row. Let's put all the white pawn on one side of the board and all the black pawns on the other side. Now let's put the rooks out in the corners. Let's follow that up by putting the knights next to the rooks. We'll soon learn that knights are placed on b and g files. In chess file is the word for column. To continue, let's put the bishops next to the knights, we'll follow that with the king and queen. Does it matter where they go? Yes it does! The queen always goes on the matching square, the white queen goes on the white squre and the black queen goes on the black square. Notice they should be lined up together finally put the kings on the last empty squares now you're ready to play, in chess each side takes only one turn at a time and by tradition white always moves first. Now that the board is setup, it's your turn to practice moves for both sides!"</small></p> <!-- transcript of the video, accessibility feature-->

                <p>Capturing chess pieces is an integral part of the game play. Capturing a piece is the same for all pieces except the pawn.</p>
                <p>For the pawn to capture, the piece in question needs to be one square in front of the pawn but <strong>diagonally</strong>. There's also a move called En Passant which is not really needed to know as a beginner yet. But as you improve on chess, definitely know that.</p>
                <p>For all other pieces, as long as the oponnent's piece is at the end of path of our piece. We take the captured piece and replace it with our piece.</p>

                    <p> To win a chess game, you need to do a <strong>checkmate</strong>. However before we get to checkmates, we should learn what <strong>check</strong> is. </p>
                    
                    <p>To check your opponent's king means to put the opponent's king in the way of one of your piece's possible next moves. When this happen we call it "the king is in check". The opponenet at this point can't do any moves, other than getting the king out of the way of any piece's path.</p>
                    
                    <p>Checkmate happens when the king has no possible way to get out check. Here's another great video that we found from Chess.com on YouTube that is also a great resource for learning more on chess:</p>

                    <p><small>[Transcript of the video above]: If a king is in check and it cannot escape check by moving, blocking or capturing, then the king is set to be in checkmate. That means you win or maybe your opponent won. Again checkmate is the entire goal of chess, doesn't matter who has captured the most pieces or how long it has taken or anything else. If the king is in checkmate, it's game over. Once the king is in checkmate, you don't have to take the king off the board, it's time to shake hands and sat good game. Now it's your turn to checkmate."</small></p> <!-- transcript of the video, accessibility feature-->

                     <p> Now that you have learned how to move te chess pieces, set up the chessboard, capture chess pieces, and winning a chess game, you can start to play a chess game and build up from there. The game of chess, consists of three basic parts: Opening, Mid-game and End-game. You will hear chess players talk about different openning, mid-game strategies or end-game strategies. No worries about that yet, but it's good to be at least somewhat familiar with the vocabulary so that you would learn about it later. </p>
                    
                    <p> In the beginning of the game, the main strategy at the beginning of the game is to take control of the 4 squares in the middle of the board. That is what most of the openings have been strategized around. The most common first chess move is to bring the king's pawn to square e4 (e is the column and 4 is the row) and followed by that is the move e5 from the opponent. The moves after that are there to support the pawns in the 4 squares in the middle.</p>
                    
                    <p>From here on, it generally a good rule to make sure your pieces all protected and that you won't lose your most valuable pieces. As you get better at chess, you will eventually learn to sacrifice your pieces in your strategy. If you lose pieces, it's not the end of the game immediately (unless you lose too many). Remember the end goal is to checkmate. As soon as that's done, the game is over!</p>
